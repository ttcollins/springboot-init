# Kick off Journey with Spring Boot
I'm using this project to dive into Spring Boot. 

Hit me up if you want to take part.

I look forward to using this project to familiarise myself with Spring Boot while implementing the following;
* REST WebAPI
* DB Interaction
* API Documentation with Swagger
* Spring Security
* OAuth

The list will keep growing as I discover more of the wonderful features Spring Boot has.
